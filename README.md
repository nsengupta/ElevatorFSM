Well, the Internet is full of articles/blogs/code that explain/demonstrate how to model
an elevator's functions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). What the heck!
I thought of adding one more. :-)

But, my intention is not to repeat the old story. I want to try and model the following,
using one elevator as an unit:

- Behaviour of a single elevator (or a lift, as is referred to in my part of the world)
- Controlling its behaviour from a, well, Controller
- Modeling a collection of lifts, as is seen in hotels
- Coordination between these lifts and the controller
- Accounting for h/w devices in the lifts, which send asynchronous signals (messages) to the lifts they are attached to

I don't expect to complete this at one go. Instead, I will build it phase-wise.

The blog is here (to be inserted).
